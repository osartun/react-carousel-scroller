# React Carousel Scroller

An application agnostic scrolling React component for controllable carousels.

**Please Note:** Though I use this package [on my own website](https://thytos.com) I don't necessarily consider it ready for production as it is so far undocumented and untested (other than manually during development). If you want to experiment with it and maybe even contribute to this repo â€“ that's great! Fork it and let the PRs roll in! Otherwise any use is on your own risk.

**Demo:** Try it out on this GitHub Page: https://osartun.github.io/react-carousel-scroller/
The demo also includes a section to showcase the JSX code you'd write. The code for the demo is in the [`docs/` folder](https://github.com/osartun/react-carousel-scroller/tree/master/docs).
